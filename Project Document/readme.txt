                                         SIGNIFICANT OF EARTHQUAKE HAPPENS USING DATA SCIENCE TECHNIQUE

1. Open Anaconda Navigator and click on Jupyter Notebook then launch the Jupyter Notebook


2. Open the Jupyter Notebook prompt in that url is there just past it in browser.


3. Inside the Desktop, our code is availabe.


4. Click on code there are totally 6 modules are there M1,M2,M3,M4,M5,M6
                          M1= Data preprocessing/cleaning
                          M2= Data Visualization
                          M3= Logistic Regression
                          M4= Random Forest
                          M5= Naivee Bayes
                          M6= Decision Tree


5. To run the modules cell --> Run All.


6. Pick the Module which has highest Accuracy.


7. Inside the code there is deploy file just click on it.


8. Run the deploy file then it will show some local host address copy and paste it on new tab.


9. In the GUI page it will some factors like latitude,longitude and some important factors give the appropriate value.


10.Click on Predict.


11. Finally it will predict whether the Earthquake will happen or not.
